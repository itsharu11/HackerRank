This code is written in Python and it appears to be a simple command-line interface program that takes user input to perform operations on a list. 

Let's break down each line of code:

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
```
This is a Python convention to ensure that the code only runs if the script is executed directly and not imported as a module.

```
N = int(input())
```
This line prompts the user to enter an integer N and converts it to an integer using the `int()` function. The value of N is used as the number of iterations to perform in the while loop.

```
i=0
myList = []
```
This line initializes two variables - i is set to 0 and myList is set to an empty list. 

```
while i < N:
```
This begins a while loop that will iterate N number of times, where N is the value entered by the user.

```
option = input()
```
This line prompts the user to enter a command and stores it in the `option` variable.

```
if option == 'print':
    print(myList)
```
If the user enters 'print' as the command, this block of code prints the current state of `myList` using the `print()` function.

```
if option == 'sort':
    myList = sorted(myList)
```
If the user enters 'sort' as the command, this block of code sorts the elements of `myList` in ascending order using the `sorted()` function and updates `myList` to contain the sorted elements.

```
if option == 'pop':
    myList.pop()
```
If the user enters 'pop' as the command, this block of code removes and returns the last element of `myList` using the `pop()` method.

```
if option == 'reverse':
    myList = myList[::-1]
```
If the user enters 'reverse' as the command, this block of code reverses the order of elements in `myList` using slicing with a step value of -1 and updates `myList` to contain the reversed elements.

```
if option.startswith("remove"):
    element = int(option.split()[1])
    myList.remove(element)
```
If the user enters a command that starts with 'remove', this block of code removes the specified element from `myList` using the `remove()` method. The element is extracted from the command using the `split()` method to split the command into a list of strings and the second element of the list is converted to an integer using the `int()` function.

```
if option.startswith("append"):
    element=int(option.split()[1])
    myList.append(element)
```
If the user enters a command that starts with 'append', this block of code adds the specified element to the end of `myList` using the `append()` method. The element is extracted from the command using the `split()` method to split the command into a list of strings and the second element of the list is converted to an integer using the `int()` function.

```
if option.startswith("insert"):
    position, element = int(option.split()[1]), int(option.split()[2])
    myList.insert(position, element)
```
If the user enters a command that starts with 'insert', this block of code inserts the specified element at the specified position in `myList` using the `insert()` method. The position and element are extracted from the command using the `split()` method to split the command into a list of strings, and the second and third elements of the list are converted to integers using the `int()` function.

```
i+=1
```
This line increments the value of i by 1 at the
