```
1. n = int(input())  
```
This line of code takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. It is assumed that the user is prompted to input a number which represents the length of the integer list to be inputted in the next line.

```
2. integer_list = map(int, input().split())  
```
This line of code takes an input from the user, splits the input into a list of strings, and maps the `int()` function to each element in the list. This converts each string element to an integer. The resulting list of integers is then assigned to the variable `integer_list`.

```
3. my_tuple = tuple(integer_list)  
```
This line of code creates a tuple `my_tuple` from the elements in `integer_list`. A tuple is similar to a list, but it is immutable, meaning that its elements cannot be changed once it is created.

```
4. print(hash(my_tuple))  
```
This line of code takes the hash value of `my_tuple` and prints it to the console. The `hash()` function takes an object and returns a unique hash value for that object. In this case, `my_tuple` is being hashed, which generates a unique identifier based on the values in the tuple.
