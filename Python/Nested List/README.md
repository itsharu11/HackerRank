This code allows the user to input the number of students in a class and their names and grades. It then finds the second lowest grade and prints the names of all the students who received that grade in alphabetical order.

Here's how it works:

1. The first line of code prompts the user to input an integer value for `n`.

2. The `student` list and the `grades` list are initialized as empty lists.

3. The `for` loop iterates `n` times, prompting the user to input the name and grade of each student. The name is stored as a string in the variable `name` and the grade is stored as a float in the variable `grade`. Each name and grade is added to the `student` list as a sublist.

4. Each grade is also added to the `grades` list.

5. The `set()` function is used to create a set of unique values from the `grades` list. The `sorted()` function is used to sort the set in ascending order. The second smallest grade is then assigned to the variable `sl`.

6. Another `for` loop iterates over the `student` list, which has sublists containing each student's name and grade. Each sublist is sorted alphabetically by name using the `sorted()` function.

7. For each sublist in the sorted `student` list, if the grade matches the second lowest grade (`sl`), then the name of the student is printed using `print(student[0])`. The square bracket notation is used to access the first element of the sublist, which is the name of the student.

Overall, this code finds the names of the students who received the second lowest grade in the class and prints them in alphabetical order.
